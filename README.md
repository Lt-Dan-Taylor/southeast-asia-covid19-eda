In this project, I'll explore and analyze COVID-19 data in Southeast Asia (SEA) using datasets from the World Health Organization and Kaggle. Southeast Asia comprises ten diverse nations, including Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, with a combined population of 688 million. The main goal is to conduct a comprehensive COVID-19 analysis in this diverse region as part of my data analytics learning journey. Open discussions, advice, and critique are encouraged
